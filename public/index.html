        <p>Hi! My name is Alexander Harris. I am a Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. This
            is currently my Junior year at Rose-Hulman. I am from Hidalgo Illinois, and currently live at Village
            Quarter in Terre Haute, Indiana during the school year. I am currently enrolled in CSSE280, CSSE432,
            CSSE474, and ECE332. Some of my hobbies include: video games, programming (video games, etc.), taking on
            small projects, watching popular television shows, and hanging out with my roommate.</p>
        <p>When I leave Rose-Hulman, I hope to get a great job opportunity soon after. I will most likely be getting my
            Master Degree after some time in the work-space. I am unsure as to where I intend on living after college,
            but those issues will come to me later! As of right now, all I need to worry about is getting an internship,
            and learning many great things during my time at Rose-Hulman. I enjoy learning and taking on new
            experiences, as I find it enjoyable to be able to do a variety of things. That is what I primary spend my
            time doing while I am here at Rose.</p>
